## Dataset

This project uses a public Transfermarkt-style dataset containing players' ages and market values.

The dataset is not stored in this repository to avoid size/licensing issues.

To reproduce the analysis:
1. Download the dataset (CSV) from Kaggle (Transfermarkt market values)
2. Place it in this folder as: `market_values.csv`
